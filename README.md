# Backroads-Tour-Website-Flexbox-JS

I have made a Tour website showcasing my Front-end and a bit of Back-end skills. This website allows users to book tour packages for various destinations worldwide.

The website is organized into four main sections: Navbar, header, about page, services, featured tours, contact, gallery, and footer.

I've gained proficiency in creating simple websites by learning to structure the code properly. Once you grasp the right approach, it becomes effortless. In this project, I leveraged CSS custom properties (variables) to define values that I could reuse consistently across the entire stylesheet. Using global variables, I styled margin, padding, and box-sizing by default.

JavaScript was utilized to enable the Navbar to collapse into a hamburger icon when the page is minimized. For icons, I used Font-awesome, while Pexels.com provided the images. Google Fonts were employed for the font styles. The project is hosted on Netlify for easy access.

I enhanced the hero section's background image by adding a cool effect, making it more opaque using a linear gradient. I also incorporated media queries to ensure the background image disappears below 768 pixels. In the featured tours section, I used a div card to neatly display all the booking information in one container, including an image, heading tag, paragraph tag, and a span tag.

For the contact section, I designed an input text field for users to enter their email addresses and a submit button. In the gallery, I used eight different images from Pexels.com, and the layout adjusts the number of columns depending on the page span.

I welcome your feedback on my project and any suggestions for improvement. Thank you for taking the time to view my work!
